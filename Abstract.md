# Newton's Inverse Square Law to 1/r Gravitational Behavior: Foundations of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) #


## Abstract ##

This paper aims to establish a theoretical foundation for the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) equations 
originally developed by M. Milgrom. The central idea is to demonstrate that there exists a critical 
cross-sectional limit below which the familiar gravitational law of ![image](https://github.com/Riddhiman2005/The-Search-for-a-New-Model-for-Studying-the-nature-of-DM/assets/130882317/4f5a99f7-f259-4dab-9677-64011f863900)
 asymptotically transitions to

When the cross-sectional area of a distant celestial body falls below the minimum cross-sectional area 
associated with the trajectories of gravitons, the conventional inverse square law of gravity ceases to be applicable.
In such cases, gravitational attraction becomes contingent on the distance traversed by the gravitons, leading to 
a gravitational force that varies as ![image](https://github.com/Riddhiman2005/The-Search-for-a-New-Model-for-Studying-the-nature-of-DM/assets/130882317/f7ba2dfe-bd7f-4d1d-9874-9a40b05e1396).
Furthermore, the mass term represented as GM in Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation is modified to ![image](https://github.com/Riddhiman2005/The-Search-for-a-New-Model-for-Studying-the-nature-of-DM/assets/130882317/c697b967-c607-45af-9914-c994e6b0b618)
. 
This modification arises from the merging of multiple graviton trajectories into a single path.
Geodesics, which are the paths followed by particles in freefall under the influence of gravity, possess exceedingly small cross-sectional areas. 
These geodesics continually adjust and resonate in response to changes in the underlying space-time, contributing to the observed deviations from the traditional ![image](https://github.com/Riddhiman2005/The-Search-for-a-New-Model-for-Studying-the-nature-of-DM/assets/130882317/d4a4dbcc-6670-4a1e-a1a6-56481580bf43)
