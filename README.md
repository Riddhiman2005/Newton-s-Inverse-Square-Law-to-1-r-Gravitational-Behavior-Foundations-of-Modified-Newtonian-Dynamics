# The Search for a New Model for Studying the Nature of DM #

Dark matter(DM), an elusive form of matter that does not interact with
light, presents a significant challenge to scientists seeking to unravel its 
mysteries. Scientists have discovered the existence of a mysterious particle called
the ”dark particle” that has managed to elude detection. 
Its role in the universe is quite intricate and closely connected to the behavior of the familiar
particles that emit light. To effectively study and understand this particle,
we suggest two important changes. Firstly, we should move away from the
current understanding of the universe known as the ΛCDM scenario. 
Secondly, we need to adopt a new way of thinking about the universe, a different
perspective, that goes beyond the conventional ideas we currently rely on to
gain a deeper understanding of the dark particle and its complex interactions
with the rest of the universe
